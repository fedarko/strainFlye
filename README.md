strainFlye is a pipeline for calling, analyzing, and phasing rare mutations
in metagenome-assembled genomes produced from HiFi sequencing data.

This repository is under active development; we're working on porting our code
from ad hoc analyses to an easier-to-use pipeline. In the meantime, if you have
any questions, please feel free to open an issue.
