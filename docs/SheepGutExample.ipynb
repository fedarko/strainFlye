    "# Tutorial: applying strainFlye to the SheepGut dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through some of the analyses that strainFlye can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will be using the same SheepGut dataset that is used in our paper, but feel free to follow along with another dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline takes as input two primary types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A __set of reads__ (in FASTA / FASTQ format).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A __set of contigs__ (in FASTA format) assembled from these reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Details about the inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regarding reads:** We designed strainFlye in the context of PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) \"HiFi\" reads ([Wenger & Peluso _et al._, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0217-9)). However, in theory it should still work with other reasonably long and accurate reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regarding contigs:** We don't impose any restriction on the assembler you use to construct these. We designed strainFlye in the context of [metaFlye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) ([Kolmogorov _et al._, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0217-9)) output, but it should work with the outputs of other HiFi assemblers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The SheepGut dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the paper's \"Data access\" section for details about acquiring both of these types of data for the SheepGut dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the \"contigs\" we use for the SheepGut datatset really correspond to edge sequences in the `assembly_graph.gfa` file produced by metaFlye -- in general, these may be slightly different from the file of contigs / scaffolds in the `assembly.fasta` file produced by metaFlye: see [Flye's manual](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye/blob/flye/docs/USAGE.md#output) for more information. (You could use either type of sequence with strainFlye, although I personally recommend using edges -- it's useful to have context about where exactly in the assembly graph a sequence is, and things like gaps in scaffolds will cause strainFlye to complain.)"

This is standard practice (see, e.g., [this tutorial](https://astrobiomike.github.io/genomics/metagen_anvio#mapping-our-reads-to-the-assembly-they-built)); aligning reads against all contigs probably yields a more accurate alignment than just aligning reads against a subset of these contigs (although proving if this is \"best practice\" or not is a challenging question, and one that I will sidestep right now).\n",

In theory, these long contigs represent putative metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).\n",

    "### 2.2. Understanding these (sub)commands\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, note that `strainFlye call` doesn't do anything besides show help info if you run it by itself. This is because, unlike `strainFlye align`, `strainFlye call` has two subcommands: `p-mutation` and `r-mutation`. Which of these you use will depend on how you want to naïvely call mutations. You can invoke one of these subcommands by writing out the full chain of commands: for example, `strainFlye call p-mutation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1. Input and output\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the most important parameter at this step is the *minimum threshold*. Both of these subcommands, `strainFlye call p-mutation` and `strainFlye call r-mutation`, take as input a minimum version of their corresponding threshold (either `--min-p` or `--min-r`).\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands each output:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A __BCF (binary [variant call format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf)) file__ describing all mutations called naïvely across the contigs, based on the minimum $p$ or $r$ threshold set (`--min-p` or `--min-r`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A __TSV ([tab separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values)) file__ describing the contigs' computed diversity indices, for various values of $p$ or $r$ (controllable using the `--div-index-p-list` or `--div-index-r-list` parameters). Long story short, diversity indices indicate how many of a contig's (sufficiently-covered) positions have called mutations: in general, higher diversity indices mean more mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2. Interpreting the output\n",
    "\n",
    "The default minimum value of $p$ (or $r$) used in these commands is fairly low. As you might expect, using such a low threshold for calling a position as a mutation will yield many false positives: we will almost certainly identify many real mutations, but also many \"false\" mutations that occur as the result of sequencing errors, alignment errors, etc. Viewed another way, the __false discovery rate (FDR)__ (defined as the ratio of false positives to total true + false positives) of the mutation calls generated at this step will probably be unacceptably high.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, after we run this command, we'll use strainFlye's FDR estimation and fixing functionality to try to address this problem. This will involve adjusting the \"minimum\" value of $p$ or $r$ used for each contig to reduce the FDR as needed. To emphasize the point, **you probably shouldn't use the naïvely called mutations at this step for downstream analyses without first estimating and fixing FDRs** (unless you know what you're doing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Naïvely call $p$-mutations ($p = 0.15\\%$) and compute diversity indices for various values of $p$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what we're doing, we're ready to call mutations and compute diversity indices! We'll do $p$-mutation calling at a minimum $p$ of $0.15\\%$, which matches what we used for Figure 2 in the paper. The default diversity index values of $p$ (ranging from $0.5\\%$ to $50\\%$) should be good for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this command will take a while—we need to check each position in the alignment for each of the input contigs. We will use the `--verbose` flag to display some extra information about the status of each contig while this command is running, to make the wait more tolerable."
