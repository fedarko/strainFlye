    "# Tutorial: applying strainFlye to the \"SheepGut\" dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through the various commands strainFlye offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Following this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your dataset and goals, you could either walk through the entirety of this document or skip around a bit. You can \"jump to\" many steps of the pipeline without trouble; for example, if you already have a BCF file of single-nucleotide mutations, you may prefer to skip all of the naïve mutation calling / FDR estimation steps and jump to the phasing analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many of the steps of this pipeline will take a while (in my experience: for the full SheepGut dataset on our cluster, \"a while\" usually means around a day). Smaller datasets and/or faster machines should of course decrease this duration. Step 5 of this tutorial (\"**Optional: Filter the FASTA file in order to focus on certain contigs**\") discusses how you can subset your dataset, after the `align` step, to certain contigs of interest; this will also speed things up.\n",

    "## 1. The two main strainFlye inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The strainFlye pipeline takes as input two main types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A __set of reads__ (in FASTA / FASTQ format).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A __set of contigs__ (in FASTA format) assembled from these reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes that you're starting the pipeline at the beginning (with `align`). Later pipeline steps will require other inputs that can be produced by intermediate pipeline steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Details about these types of inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regarding reads:** We designed strainFlye in the context of PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) \"HiFi\" reads ([Wenger & Peluso _et al._, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0217-9)). However, in theory it should still work with other reasonably long and accurate reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regarding contigs:** We don't impose any restriction on the assembler you use to construct these. We have tested strainFlye on [metaFlye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) ([Kolmogorov _et al._, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-00971-x)) and [hifiasm-meta](https://github.com/xfengnefx/hifiasm-meta) ([Feng _et al._, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01478-3)) output, but it should in theory work with the outputs of other HiFi assemblers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. The SheepGut dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be applying strainFlye to the SheepGut dataset that is shown in our paper. (This dataset has also been described in ([Kolmogorov _et al._, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-00971-x) and [Bickhart & Kolmogorov _et al._, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01130-z).) Please see the strainFlye paper's \"Data access\" section for details about acquiring reads and contigs for the SheepGut dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the \"contigs\" we use for the SheepGut datatset really correspond to edge sequences in the `assembly_graph.gfa` file produced by metaFlye. These edge sequences may be slightly different from the file of contigs / scaffolds in the `assembly.fasta` file produced by metaFlye: see [Flye's manual](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye/blob/flye/docs/USAGE.md#output) for more information. (You could use either type of sequence with strainFlye, although I personally recommend using edges: it's useful to have context about where exactly in the assembly graph a sequence is, and things like gaps in scaffolds [represented by `N`s] will cause strainFlye to complain.)"

    "### 6.2. Understanding these (sub)commands\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, note that `strainFlye call` doesn't do anything besides show help info if you run it by itself. This is because, unlike `strainFlye align`, `strainFlye call` has two subcommands: `p-mutation` and `r-mutation`. Which of these you use will depend on how you want to naïvely call mutations. You can invoke one of these subcommands by writing out the full chain of commands: for example, `strainFlye call p-mutation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2.1. Input and output\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the most important parameter at this step is the *minimum threshold*. Both of these subcommands, `strainFlye call p-mutation` and `strainFlye call r-mutation`, take as input a minimum version of their corresponding threshold (either `--min-p` or `--min-r`).\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands each output:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A __BCF (binary [variant call format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf)) file__ describing all mutations called naïvely across the contigs, based on the minimum $p$ or $r$ threshold set (`--min-p` or `--min-r`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A __TSV ([tab separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values)) file__ describing the contigs' computed diversity indices, for various values of $p$ or $r$ (configurable using the `--div-index-p-list` or `--div-index-r-list` parameters).\n",
    "  - Long story short, diversity indices indicate how many of a contig's \"sufficiently-covered\" positions have called mutations: in general, higher diversity indices imply higher mutation rates.\n",
    "  - If enough positions in a contig are not \"sufficiently-covered,\" then we will not compute the diversity index for this contig. Please see the Supplemental Material \"Diversity index details\" in the strainFlye paper for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2.2. Interpreting the output\n",
    "\n",
    "The default minimum value of $p$ (or $r$) used in these commands is fairly low. As you might expect, using such a low threshold for calling a position as a mutation may yield many false positives: we will almost certainly identify many real mutations, but also many \"false\" mutations that happen to occur as the result of sequencing errors, alignment errors, etc. Viewed another way, the __[false discovery rate (FDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate)__ (defined as the ratio of false positives to total true + false positives) of the mutation calls generated at this step will probably be high—although this depends on a variety of factors, including which contig(s) we are focusing on mutations in, what our goals are in the first place, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### FDR estimation and fixing\n",
    "\n",
    "After we run this command, we can use strainFlye's FDR estimation and fixing functionality to attempt to address this problem. This process involves adjusting the \"minimum\" value of $p$ (or $r$) used for each contig to reduce the FDR as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your dataset and your goals, you may or may not want to do this: as of writing, many of the analyses in the strainFlye paper don't perform FDR fixing on their input mutations, and instead just make use of \"un-fixed\" naïvely called $p$-mutations. (That being said, this is mostly a historical artifact of us implementing the FDR fixing code close to the end of the project.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if you are going to perform FDR estimation / fixing, we recommend only doing this for $p$-mutations (and not $r$-mutations); this is discussed in the strainFlye paper, in the Supplemental Material section named \"Identifying mutations based solely on read counts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3. Naïvely call $p$-mutations ($p = 0.15\\%$) and compute diversity indices for various values of $p$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what we're doing, we're ready to call mutations and compute diversity indices! We'll do $p$-mutation calling at a minimum $p$ of $0.15\\%$, which matches what we used for Figure 2 in the paper. The default diversity index values of $p$ (ranging from $0.5\\%$ to $50\\%$) should be good for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like alignment, this command will also take a while—we need to check each position in the alignment for each of the input contigs. If you'd like, you can use the `--verbose` flag to display some extra information while this command is running, to make the wait more tolerable (and assure you that it isn't frozen somewhere)."

Similarly, we know from ([Korem, Zeevi, Suez _et al._, 2015](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aac4812)) that the coverage throughout a MAG can also be indicative of the origin of replication.\n",

(Why are they _anti-correlated_, specifically? The skew minimum indicates the origin of replication, and coverage for a genome undergoing replication should be at its maximum near the origin of replication.)\n",
